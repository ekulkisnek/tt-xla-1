# OpenXLA Partitioner Tool

This directory contains an experimental tool for encapsulating the OpenXLA
multi-node partitioner tool and APIs. Much of the implementation is presently
derived from the `/xla` codebase under the covers.

Once somewhat mature, a permanent home will be identified for this
piece. In the meantime, it is being developed next to the PJRT plugin, into
which it needs to be integrated.
