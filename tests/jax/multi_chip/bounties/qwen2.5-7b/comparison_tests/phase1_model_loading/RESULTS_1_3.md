# Phase 1.3 Results: Model Architecture Verification

## Status: âœ… PASSED

## Summary
Both PyTorch and JAX implementations have identical model architectures with all critical components matching exactly.

## Key Findings
- **All 15 architectural components match**
- Model structure is identical:
  - 28 decoder layers with attention + MLP
  - Each layer has input and post-attention layer norms
  - Hidden size: 3584, Intermediate size: 18,944
  - 28 attention heads with 4 KV heads (GQA)
  - Vocabulary size: 152,064

## Parameter Count Analysis
- **Total parameters: 7,615,616,512 (7.6B)**
- Parameter count calculation confirmed exact match
- Model includes attention bias terms (PyTorch standard)
- Embeddings are NOT tied (separate embed_tokens and lm_head)

## Critical Discovery for JAX Implementation
The PyTorch model includes **bias terms** in attention projections (q_proj, k_proj, v_proj), which the JAX implementation must include to match exactly.

## Next Steps
**ACTION REQUIRED**: Update JAX model to include attention bias terms before proceeding to Phase 2.
Ready to proceed to **Phase 2: Tokenization Consistency** after bias fix.
